    "### `n_estimators and early_stopping_rounds`\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost has a few parameters that can dramatically affect your model's accuracy and training speed.  The first parameters you should understand are: `n_estimators and early_stopping_rounds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`n_estimators` specifies how many times to go through the modeling cycle described above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the [underfitting vs overfitting graph](http://i.imgur.com/2q85n9s.png), n_estimators moves you further to the right.  Too low a value causes underfitting, which is inaccurate predictions on both training data and new data. Too large a value causes overfitting, which is accurate predictions on training data, but inaccurate predictions on new data (which is what we care about). You can experiment with your dataset to find the ideal.  Typical values range from 100-1000, though this depends a lot on the `learning rate` discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument `early_stopping_rounds` offers a way to automatically find the ideal value. Early stopping causes the model to stop iterating when the validation score stops improving, even if we aren't at the hard stop for n_estimators.  It's smart to set a high value for `n_estimators` and then use `early_stopping_rounds` to find the optimal time to stop iterating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since random chance sometimes causes a single round where validation scores don't improve, you need to specify a number for how many rounds of straight deterioration to allow before stopping.  `early_stopping_rounds = 5` is a reasonable value.  Thus we stop after 5 straight rounds of deteriorating validation scores.\n",

This means each tree we add to the ensemble helps us less.  In practice, this reduces the model's propensity to overfit.\n",
